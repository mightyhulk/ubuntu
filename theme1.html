      <h2   style=" text-align:center; color:#FF69B4;">BOOK WORLD</h2> 
      <p style="font-size:30px">This website is just like a start-ups idea. Recently only few competitors are
present in the Indian Market. Companies like <span style ="color:#FF69B4; font-size:30px">cashkaro, topcashback, gopaisa,coupondunia, grabon.</span> These companies are providing cashback if we will buy
the same product listed on different website like amazom, flipkart . You have
to click on any product on cashkaro it will redirect you to amazon and inturn
you can get little amount of cash back.</p>

   <p style="font-size:30px"> Our <span style ="color:#FF69B4; font-size:30px">BOOK SELLING WEBSITE is little bit similar to these companies.</span>
If we want to purchase any book from any website then the same book is registered at different price at different website. Our website will display the same
book which is registered at cheapest price among all the website like amazon,
flipkart. We currently only deal with book because this is one of the major problem faced by various students either he/she is in college or in school. In this way
we solve one major problem of students. We will not charge any amount like
other companies amazon and flipkart to display their product on the website.
